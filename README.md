# WalkThru
> An iOS AR instruction manual app 


Walkthru is an iOS app taking advantage of Apple's ARKit 3 to recongize images and allow users to complete complex tasks. Walkthru was designed 
for Oregon State University's Computer Science Senior Capstone project. To view the engineering expo page for Walkthru click here (Add Link when available).
Walkthru uses the image recongition available in the native AR enviorment in iOS Swift to recongize photos of distinct points of a guide. An example of a simple
Walkthru is making a Peanutbutter and Jelly sandwich. Walkthru is able to guide users through each ingredient nessecary, highlighting each ingredient allowing the 
user to keep track of progress as well as ensuring quality of completeion. Walkthru was originally intended to be a replacement for expensive auto repair manuals, 
however, it quickly become evident that the powers of image recongition could allow for many different types of processes to be made into a Walkthru.
